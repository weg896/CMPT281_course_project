						<img src="images/news/specialnews.png"/>
							The recent round of drug testing has been completed and while it has been found that none of the bears is using performance enhancing drugs 
							there have been some serious questions raised. One of the main concerns is that Puffy appears to have no blood whatsoever. Either the lab technicians
							are incompetent or somethingg strange is afoot. The drug testing for Safety bear was compromised as well when it was found that the blood sample given
							was human blood. We think it likely that it is blood from someone he mauled during the recent peta demonstration.
